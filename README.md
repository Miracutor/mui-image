### If you're already using [Material-UI v5](https://mui.com), why not display your images according to the Material guidelines too?

> Illustrations and photographs may load and transition in three phases at staggered durations, rather than relying on opacity changes alone.
>
> Visualize the image fading in, like a print during the photo development process.

## About the fork

I actually just to make a fork with small modification for my website but somehow I ended changed many things... How it became like this?

Changes in this fork:

- Rewritten fully in Typescript with types built-in.

- Better compability with MUI's styled and sx prop.

- Use Vite instead of nwb for development and building the library for fast and better developer experince for me!

- A lighter UMD build by externalize React and Material UI library. (You need both React and Material UI UMD to use this component.)

- Enable import component props for extending props to provide support for Component composition.

## Simple Q & A

- **Q**: Why you created this fork?  
  **A**: MUI's styled don't work very well with the original mui-image because className pointed to root img Element. Some CSS cannot be change or it will break styling. So, I want to modify a little bit... And I end up doing at lot.  
  Originally, I want to just post an issue for this but I am suck in comunication.

- **Q**: Are you not going to publish on NPM?  
  **A**: Probably not. I don't think there is any demand on this. I am just weird. Maybe if someone post an issue about this and 100 person comment on that issue, maybe I will do it.

- **Q**: Why you change nwb to Vite?  
  **A**: I just wanted to fork for my own benefit. So, I thought maybe I can write this in TypeScript... but it don't work with nwb. I am so frustrated that I cannot find how to do it and try migarating to Vite instead. It took a lot of work but never thought it work so well...
  Maybe there is actually a way but I never regret that.

  Vite is so fast!!!

- **Q**: Will you intergrate changes from the original project?  
  **A**: Yeah. As many as I can.

### 1. Install

```shell
npm i https://github.com/Miracutor/mui-image
```

### 2. Use

```js
import Image from 'mui-image';

<Image src="my-image.png" />;
```

### 3. Profit üí∞

_Note: Profits not guaranteed and MUI v5 is a peer dependency. If you need to support legacy versions of Material-UI, use [`material-ui-image`](https://github.com/TeamWertarbyte/material-ui-image) instead. See the [comparison chart](#comparison-with-similar-components) below for more._

## Usage Examples

You can use `mui-image` like a regular image.

```jsx
<Image src="my-image.png" />
```

Except... it will fade and animate in as the Material guidelines recommend. ü§Ø

Add a `height` and/or `width` to reserve space on the page for the image and avoid uncomforable content shifts as your picture loads. They both default to 100% of the parent you place them in and accept any valid CSS property. Numbers are converted to pixels.

```jsx
<Image src="my-image.png" width={500} />
<Image src="my-image.png" height="90vh" />
```

Apply the `showLoading` prop to add a progress indicator to let your fans know something amazing is coming. You can use the default MUI indicator or bring your own. üòé

```jsx
<Image src="my-image.png" showLoading />
<Image src="my-image.bmp" showLoading={<MyCustomSpinner />} />
```

If you want the image to fail silently you can disable the `errorIcon`, or you can add your own to suit your brand.

```jsx
<Image src="my-cats.png" errorIcon={null} />
<Image src="my-dogs.png" errorIcon={<MyErrorIcon />} />
```

If you want to _disobey Google_ üòµ then you can customise the animation and speed via the `duration` and `easing` props to any valid CSS property. Duration is always milliseconds.

```jsx
<Image src="my-fish.png" duration={325} />
<Image src="my-bird.jpg" easing="ease-in-out" />
```

To add that extra bit of spice üå∂ you can do exactly what Google suggests and apply a small position `shift` to images as they appear. The direction, distance, and duration (in milliseconds) are up to you.

```jsx
<Image src="my-lawd.png" shift="left" />
<Image src="my-gawd.jpg" shift="bottom" distance={300} />
<Image src="my-gosh.gif" shift="top" distance="2rem" shiftDuration={320} />
```

And of course, you can style `mui-image` like you would a regular image... but with the addition of the MUI v5 `sx` prop and [all the benefits](https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/) it brings. üòè

```jsx
<Image src="my-self.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: 16 }} />
<Image src="my-wife.webp" className="custom-class" />
<Image src="my-exgf.tiff" sx={{ display: { sm: 'none', lg: 'inline' }}} />
```

If you want to get fancy üíÉ you can also add inline styles and additional `className`'s to the root wrapper `div` and loading/error icon wrapper `div`, or just target their default `className`'s. This allows for complete customisation of every aspect of the component.

In this fork, className is pointed to Wrapper className and imgClassName is pointed to root img element.

### Fork Exclusive Usage

With this fork, you can use MUI's styled normally like this. More info on MUI's [official doccumentation](https://mui.com/system/styled/).

```ts
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
import Image from 'mui-image';

const customImage = styled(Image)({
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
    max-height: 500px;
});
```

You also can use composition to create custom components.

```ts
import Image, { MuiImageProps } from 'mui-image';

const customImage = ({ imgClassName, ...props }: MuiImageProps) => (
 <Image imgClassName={'some-custom-class'} {...props} />
);
```

You also can extend the props by importing props.

```ts
import Image, { MuiImageProps } from 'mui-image';

interface CustomMuiImageProps extends MuiImageProps {
 customImage: string;
}

const customImage = ({ customImage, ...props }: CustomMuiImageProps) => {
 const imageSrc = () => {
  if (customImage === 'grass') {
   return 'https//www.picture.org/grass.png';
  }

  if (customImage === 'beach') {
   return 'https//www.picture.org/beach.png';
  }
 };
 return <Image src={imageSrc()} {...props} />;
};
```

Any other props (eg. `sx`, `onLoad`) are passed directly to the native `img` element.

## Material guidelines for loading images

> #### ‚úÖ Fade-in
>
> Visualize the image fading in, like a print during the photo development process.

> #### ‚úÖ Opacity, exposure, and saturation recommendations
>
> Images should begin loading with low contrast levels and desaturated color. Once image opacity reaches 100%, display the image with full-color saturation.

> #### ‚úÖ Duration
>
> A longer duration is recommended for loading images, and a shorter duration is recommended for transitions.

> #### ‚úÖ Animation
>
> Add a small position shift to loading images.
